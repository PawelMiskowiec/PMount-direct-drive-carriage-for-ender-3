# PMOUNT Ender 3 direct drive carriage

This project was first uploaded to 
[cults3d](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/pmount-ender-3-cr10-direct-drive-for-e3d-v6-bmg-titan-5015-4010)
 where one can find tested files.  
This repo contains most up to date tested and experimental files.  
Some of experimental parts I'm using in my printer, like carriage
setup for mgn12h rails, and some e.g. bl touch mount are just modeled according to
documentation without testing(I don't use bl touch). Since I didn't get any feedback on cults according 
parts that I didn't have chance to test, those may not fit or work properly.

## MGN12H carriage setup

I'm running it in my printer without any problems for few months now, so
it's not all that experimental anymore.

Assembly requires some additional hardware, but nothing that average tinkerer shouldn't have at home.

Tensioning the belt with m5 screws is not required, it's there only to make belt's path more in line 
with profile which in theory should result in better x-axis accuracy, however after some testing I can't
say that it changed anything really.  
But if you decide to use this feature then make sure that the belt is not 
rubbing against the aluminum profile.
